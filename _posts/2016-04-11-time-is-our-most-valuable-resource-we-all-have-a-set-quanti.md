## Making the Most of My Time

Time is our most valuable resource. We all have a set quantity -- nothing can change that.

But we do have absolute control over the quality of each hour. In theory at least. My  practice needs to improve.

* How can I eliminate activities that waste time?
* How do I free time by selecting to do the right activities?
* How do I invest time in my team for the ultimate return: more time for myself?

## Time Management

Time Management deals with the efficient use of time. It helps to get things done and to reduce stress. It is focused on the quantity of time available.

## Beyond Time Management

To go a step further I want to address the effective use of time -- its quality.

Time is the one resource we have that cannot be renewed. It passes no matter what.

I used to produce international events for companies like BMW, Adidas and Citibank. I flew around the world, setting up event teams in Canada, the US, South Africa, Japan and all over Europe. I worked with Brian Ferry, Franz Beckenbauer, Heidi Klum, Donatella Versace.

And I spend many hours in the office. Often 12 hours or more.

## The Choice

One day I made a choice: From now on I would work from 8.00am to 5.00pm.

That caused quite a stir. For weeks my boss tried to wrap me into meetings just before 5.00pm. I would decline and tell him that I would be available the next day.

Can you guess what happened? No, I was not fired, on the contrary: I got much more done.

And I started having a life outside of work again. I went for walks, I got into sports, I enjoyed time with my girlfriend. It was fantastic.

## How Can I Achieve That Now?

Here is my formula I'll try to implement:

1. Spend time on things I enjoy
2. Stop wasting time
3. Free time by focusing on the most valuable activities
4. Invest time to empower my team

## Owning a Business

There are some stats out there (not sure where I heard it) that 90% of people who say they are business owners are owner operators.

I keep telling myself that as I have just started my business and am building it, that this is a special time and needs more investment in time and money than an established business.

But I do not want to forget the goal of building a team that can run it and setting up the systems that lead profitable operations.
